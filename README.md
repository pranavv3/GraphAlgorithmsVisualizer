# SHORTEST PATH FINDING VISUALIZER

Path Finding Visualiser is a 2-D maze generation and optimal path-finder that has been developed using PyGame (a Python set of modules).

It uses the heuristic A-Star algorithm to determine paths between 2 nodes in a Two-Dimenstional Grid with some obstacles in between (which is dependent on the interactive user where he/she wants to place them). Based on a heuristic function, different possible paths are traversed and once the final node is reached; using backtracking the shortest path is found and visualised. The project aims at understanding how the A-Star algorithm actually functions and can be visually interpreted.

# Requirements

Try any one of the following two commands:

Try any one of the following two commands:

python -m pip install pygame

After installing Pygame, simply run the command to run the Project: python path_visualization_using_a_star.py
